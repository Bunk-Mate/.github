# Bunk Mate
Many of us have desired to take a day off from college for various activities or simply to relax, but often refrain due to concerns about meeting the attendance requirement of 75%. The Bunk Mate app/website aims to address this dilemma by providing a convenient solution for tracking classes attended and offering live updates on the remaining classes needed to meet the attendance target.
