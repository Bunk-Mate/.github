# Bunk Mate
Many of us have desired to take a day off from college for various activities or simply to relax, but often refrain due to concerns about meeting the attendance requirement. 

The Bunk Mate platform was made to address this dilemma by providing a means for tracking your attendance and showing a calculation of how many classes you can bunk in a semester. Visit [bunkmate.in](https://www.bunkmate.in/) for the web version or get the mobile app from the [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=college.bunkmate).

Note that we are not responsible for any classes that you may fail due to this app ;)

P.S: All of our code is open source, feel free to contribute!
