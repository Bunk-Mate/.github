# Bunk Mate
Many of us have desired to take a day off from college for various activities or simply to relax, but often refrain due to concerns about meeting the attendance requirement percentage. 

The Bunk Mate platform to address this dilemma by providing a means for tracking how many classes you can bunk in a semester as well as providing live attendance percentages. Visit [bunkmate.college](https://www.bunkmate.college/) for the web version or download the [apk](https://github.com/Bunk-Mate/Mobile-App/releases) for the mobile app.

Note that we are not responsible for any classes that you may fail caused due to this app ;)
